# Project-Bea

Project Bea is an attempt to develop versatile web scraping technology that can access any part of the web. In case you were wondering, Bea is a character from 'Breaking and Entering' by Don Gillmor who breaks into houses not to steal, but to escape. In the same way, we hope to demonstrate and hone the powers of webscraping legally.
